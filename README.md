# BlockChain

Some Tests and ideas about BlockChain and its uses. 

Just remember basics uses for Blockhain : 
  * Exchange Currency (CryptoCurrencies) ; 
  * Smart Contracts (validation, execution...) for example in supply chain / anti-counterfeiting / validation ; 
  * Property certification (NFT, certificates...) ;

## Aim of this repository

This repository is to be an example of uses and implementation of BlockChain(s). 

This a 'basic' example of a monetary transferts : 'Transactions' could be recoded as exchange of property certification, contracts (smart contracts, as automatic ones, or others)... 

## Notes

Notes [20240908]
  - On tests, after some transsaction, balance not valid as attempted (present before this note)
  - How to implement stak and validation ?
  - After how many validation stak is released ?

Notes [20240925]
  - Known bug "balance not valid as attempted" not checked systematically, noted with " XXX BUG " in tests assertions removed, how to correctly check balance anyway correctly ?! (need help)
  - Check the blockchain as a graph for some behaviors (possible attacks, known or not)
  - Began implementation of proof of stak (PoS) and it's use (with validators and default)
