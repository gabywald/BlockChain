# BlockChain

Some Tests and ideas about BlockChain and its uses. 

Just remember basics uses for Blockhain : 
  * Exchange Currency (CryptoCurrencies) ; 
  * Smart Contracts (validation, execution...) for example in supply chain / anti-counterfeiting / validation ; 
  * Property certification (NFT, certificates...) ;
